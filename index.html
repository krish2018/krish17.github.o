		<P><p style="color:#8B008B"> My name is Krishanda Gaines. I study economics and sociology at the University of Georgia. I have an on-campus part time job at the student manager at Bolton Dining Commons. Hard work and dedication are important to me so I like to show that in my school work and part time job.</P>
		<P><p style="color:#8B008B"> I’m lucky enough to be heading into my fifth year of undergrad which is commonly referred to as a victory lap! Since I have two majors and have worked all through college, I don’t mind adding on an extra year. This gives me the chance to gain more experience and prepare for my future career.</P>
		<P><p style="color:#8B008B">In my spare time, I love to travel. I collect post cards and travel mugs. The travel mugs I collect the most are from the <em><a href = "https://starbucks-city-mugs.com/you-are-here-series/ " >Starbucks "You Are Here" collection </a></em>. I really enjoy the design and they're always the same price no matter the country you're in!This semester I’ve been to Disney World in Orlando and San Diego! I’m hoping to either travel in my leisure time or find a career that allows me to go to different cities across the US. Below is a table I've made to display the places I've visited myself and the places my friends have visted and brought me a souvenir.</P>
